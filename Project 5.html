<h2>IT 313 -- Project 5</h2>

<h3>Observer Software Pattern</h3>

<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Write a CurrencyMonitor class (Observable) and two observer classes Grapher and Logger.</p>

<p><strong>Deliverables:</strong> (1) Zip file of the Eclipse project, (2) UML diagram of the project drawn with software, such as Violet.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<ol type="1">
<li>Write a CurrencyMonitor class that monitors the exchange rates of five currencies of your choosing.  Use the URL
that you used for Project 2b:<br>
<pre>http://download.finance.yahoo.com/d/quotes.csv?s=EURUSD=X&amp;f=sl1d1t1ba&amp;e=.csv 
</pre>
Replace EUR with the five currency codes that you wish to monitor.<br>&nbsp;<br>
<ol type="a">
<li>CurrencyMonitor objects is are observables, so the CurrencyMonitor class extends the Observable class.
<br>&nbsp;</li>
<li>The CurrencyMonitor class should have five instance variables, one for each currency being monitored.
For example:<br>
<ul>
<pre>private double aud, cad, chf, gbp, eur;  
</pre></ul></li>
<li>Write a constructor that initializes the instance variables all to 0.0 and adds, as observers,
an object from each of the classes Grapher and Logger.
<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li>Write getters for each of the instance variables.
<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li>Write a method named checkCurrencies:<br>
<ul>
<pre>public void checkCurrencies( )
</pre></ul>
This method should set up a loop that, every 60 seconds, compares the values of 
the exchange rates in the instance variables with the currency values read from 
the internet using the above URL. If at least one of the instance variable 
exchange rates differs from the corresponding internet exchange rate, call the 
Observable setChanged method, update the instance variables, and call the 
notifyObservers method, which passes as an argument, a string with the current currency rates, 
for example, <span class="tt">"0.78,0.81,1.05,1.55,1.13"</span>.
This string represents the source exchange rates for converting to USD for the 
currency codes AUD, CAD, CHF, GBP, EUR.</li>
</ol><br></li>

<li>Write a Logger class that graphs the exchange rates that the CurrencyMonitor class is monitoring.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<ol type="a">
<li>The Logger class is an observer, so it implements the Observer interface.
<br>&nbsp;</li>
<li>Define the instance variable logFileName.  See the Casino Example in the observable examples file.
<br>&nbsp;</li>
<li>Write a constructor that initializes logFileName.
<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li>Write an update method:<br>
<ul>
<pre>public void update(Observable obs, Object info)
</pre></ul>
This method should obtain the info exchange rate string, use split to extract the fields, and use double.ParseDouble to 
convert the exchange rates to numbers.  These exchange rates should then be written to a log file.&nbsp; 
Never call this method directly; it is called automatically by the 
notifyObservers method of the Observable base class.</li>
</ol><br></li>

<li>Write a Grapher class.  This class should be similar to the Logger class in 2, but instead of appending
the currency rates to the log file, it should create a bargraph of the current currency rates that
are obtained from the update method.&nbsp; The solution to Project 3b, which we 
will discuss on Monday, 3/2, may be useful.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Grading Breakdown:</strong> Functionality 70%, Indentation 10%, Comments 10%, Header with your name, 
project number, and submission date 5%, Submitted properly, including name and project number in Java project name
and zip file name 5%</p>
